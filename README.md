# Description

Translator is a simple yet efficient web application designed to provide quick and accurate translations. The user interface is minimalistic and beautiful, making it convenient and enjoyable to use.

The server-side of Translator is built with ASP.NET Core 7, a modern, fast, and powerful platform for creating cloud applications. It uses Azure Translator, a robust and reliable translation service, to translate the text.

The [client-side](https://github.com/BnnQ/TranslatorClient) is built with React 18, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This combination of technologies ensures that Translator is not only efficient and fast, but also scalable and maintainable.

Despite its simplicity - just select a language and enter the text - Translator stands out for its efficiency, speed, and user-friendly design. It's a testament to the fact that sometimes, less is more.
